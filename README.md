# isolate
Isolate original matrices into chain of set of matrices.

# Descriptions
One of some machine learning methods produces the correnspondance with tan A\[x, y\]==0 as invariant.
Some of the mutilayer methods concludes same as them but the structure is tan A B...\[x, y\]==0.
They excludes decomposition as some layers.

So this aims to get from last matrices tan A\_k\[x, y\] == 0 learned matrices, tan A'\_k B \[x, y\] == 0
with the condition A\_k -\> A'\_k reduces some of accuracy, B is the same matrix.
